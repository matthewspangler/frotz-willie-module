This plugin pipes interactive fiction games into IRC! Works on Willie IRC bots hosted in Unix/Linux only.

Setup: Requires a frotz build. You can get dfrotz from my frotz github repository (https://github.com/Shardvex/frotz). Rename the frotz binary to dfrotz and place in willie's top directory. Put some z-machines games in ./games.

Commands: .listgames | .startgame <game> | .endgame | >action (for playing the game)
